# MDM Configuration file.
#
# This file is the appropriate place for specifying your customizations to the
# MDM configuration. If you run mdmsetup, it will automatically edit this
# file for you and will cause the daemon and any running MDM GUI programs to
# automatically update with the new configuration. Not all configuration
# options are supported by mdmsetup, so to modify some values it may be
# necessary to modify this file directly by hand.
#
# This file overrides the default configuration settings. These settings 
# are stored in the MDM System Defaults configuration file, which is found
# at the following location.
#
# /usr/share/mdm/defaults.conf.
#
# Default settings are first overriden by you distribution in /usr/share/mdm/distro.conf
# and then by the settings present in this file.
#
# This file contains comments about the meaning of each configuration option,
# so is also a useful reference. In short, to hand-edit
# this file, simply add or modify the key=value combination in the
# appropriate section in the template below this comment section.
#
# For example, if you want to specify a different value for the Enable key
# in the "[debug]" section of your MDM System Defaults configuration file,
# then add "Enable=true" in the "[debug]" section of this file.  If the
# key already exists in this file, then simply modify it.
#
# If you hand edit a MDM configuration file, you can run the following
# command and the MDM daemon will immediately reflect the change.  Any
# running MDM GUI programs will also be notified to update with the new
# configuration.
#
# mdmflexiserver --command="UPDATE_CONFIG <configuration key>"
#
# e.g, the "Enable" key in the "[debug]" section would be "debug/Enable".
#
# You can also run mdm-restart or mdm-safe-restart to cause MDM to restart and
# re-read the new configuration settings.  You can also restart MDM by sending
# a HUP or USR1 signal to the daemon.  HUP behaves like mdm-restart and causes
# any user session started by MDM to exit immediately while USR1 behaves like
# mdm-safe-restart and will wait until all users log out before restarting MDM.

# Also note, that if you redefine a [server-foo] section, then MDM will
